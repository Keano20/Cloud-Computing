                <h2>Tech Giants in Cloud Computing</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Within the technology sector there is a plethora of extremely large companies that have a profound global reach. To achieve this reach these companies 
                    rely heavily on cloud computing. Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data and applications over the internet rather than on a physical hard drive.
                    This technology has revolutionised the way businesses operate and has allowed for a more efficient and cost effective way of storing and accessing data. </p>
                
                </p>

            <section id="revenue">
                <h3>Revenue</h3>
                <p>It's no suprise that the core goal of any business is to generate as much revenue as possible whilst keeping overhead costs as low as possible.
                    With cloud computing this has become easier than. An article published by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-cloud-computing-has-revolutionized-business-success-cpoxf">Tech Supersonic</a>
                    states that "The pay-as-you-go model of cloud services eliminates the need for substantial upfront investments in hardware. This cost-effectiveness has democratized access to advanced technologies for businesses of all sizes."
                </p>

                <p>This shows a huge contrast between past and present day businesses, as in the past they would have to spend alot of money buying physical hardware that they may or may not end up fully utalising. But now with
                    the advancents being made in cloud computing companies can choose exactly how many resources they want to invest based on their real time usage and scale it up and down with the click of a few buttons based on their needs. </p>

                <p>Whilst implimentinng cloud services can save you alot of money, the opposite is also true, escpecially for large companies. As <a href="https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2023/oct/24/40-of-firms-lose-revenue-from-technology-downtime-and-cloud-complexity/">cloudcomputing-news</a>
                goes on to explain that "56% of businesses reported a significant impact on revenue due to technology downtime." what this means is that keeping your cloud systems running and minimising downtime is absolutly vital to extracting the most effeciency out of your systems, if not you cloud-based-workloads
                find that running costs start to become more expensive as you are paying for systems that arent providing any income.</p>
                
            
            <section id="Risk Management">
                <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                <p>Another key factor in companies adopting more and more cloud services is to manage risk, for example if you have all employees working on one secure centralised network that automatically backs itself up and is is monitored for securtiy breaches 24/7
                    you reduce the risk of data loss errors or breaches significantly.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.codestone.net/our-thoughts/the-top-10-business-benefits-of-cloud-computing-2/">Codestone</a> went on to state that "There have been many instances where a power surge has destroyed an in-house server, which has led to a great deal of valuable information being lost, as well as the resultant downtime affecting productivity.
                     With the data secure and the fact that minimal IT equipment is kept on site, it not only removes the concern of security and data loss, it should also reduce insurance premiums."</p>

                <p>The qualititive data that has been researched clearly shows a trend that when companies use cloud computing technologies in an effective manner it has an exponential effect throughout the organisation and can be the difference in whether their goals are achieved or not.</p>
