            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Over the past few decades Artificial intellignce (AI) has been rising to the forefront of business development. 
                It is responsible for a wide range of tasks spanning across many different sectors. One of these leading technologies is cloud computing. 
                which has not only completely revolutionised the business sector but also the world.</p>

            <p> For example <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2023/11/28/how-cloud-computing-revolutionized-business-operations-and-what-lies-ahead/#:~:text=Cloud%20computing%20has%20dismantled%20the,by%20provisioning%20resources%20on%2Ddemand.>Forbes </a>
                states that "Few technological advancements have had as profound an impact as the rise of cloud computing. Looking back at the cloud revolution illustrates how this paradigm has reshaped global business operations. From established enterprises optimizing their workloads, to startups "born in the cloud," the cloud's impact is pervasive
                 and continually shaping the landscape of innovation.".</p>

            <p>This perfectly highlights just how engrained cloud computing has become within the world of technology, and has gone from being an afterthought, to being an industry standard.</p>
