                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>It's no surprise that given how easily accesible technology is becoming, many new startups will want to give themeselves the best possible chance of breakinng into their 
                    chosen field and trying to get as much of the market share as possible with <a href="https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-computing-statistics/">Cloudzero</a> saying "The global cloud computing market grew from $24.63 billion in 2010 to $156.4 billion in 2020.
                     Thatâ€™s a 635% jump." This jump indicates that now more than ever, startups and small businesses neet be implimenting these technologies sooner rather than later.</p>
                
                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                     <p>Some of the benefits of implimenting cloud features for a small business are, time saving, money saving and increased workflow. These 3 things together can be the difference between
                        a business that fails and one that goes on to have large amounts of sucess.</p>

                    <p>According to <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/startup-failure-stats">Josh Howarth, from explodingtopics,</a> 90% of startups across all industries fail
                    within the first 5 years. Alot of this will be due to lack of cloud implemention, or poorly implimented cloud structures. </p>

                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                        <p>Cloud-based collaboration tools, such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, facilitate seamless communication and collaboration among team members, regardless of their location. 
                            Small businesses can leverage these tools to improve productivity, streamline workflows, and foster teamwork in remote or distributed work environments.</p>
                
                <h3>Global Reach</h3>
                        <p>The scalability and accessibility of cloud computing enable small businesses to expand their reach and enter new markets with minimal barriers.
                             Cloud-based e-commerce platforms, digital marketing tools, and online marketplaces empower small businesses to reach customers worldwide, driving growth and revenue opportunities beyond traditional geographic boundaries </p>
